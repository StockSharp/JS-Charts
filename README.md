**StockSharp JS Trading Charts** is a canvas trading-chart engine: one chart owns
native panes and a single time axis, with custom series, primitives, indicators,
exact order flow (footprint / volume profile / TPO) and a broker-agnostic trading
layer — published as a typed ESM package and the `SSChart` global.

The indicators it draws come from
[`@stocksharp/indicators`](https://github.com/StockSharp/JS-Indicators) — ~165 of
them, checked against the C# StockSharp platform. That package is this engine's only
runtime dependency, and it can be used on its own by anything that wants the numbers
without a chart.

## Quick start

```sh
npm install @stocksharp/chart
```

```ts
import { createChart, CandlestickSeries } from '@stocksharp/chart';

const chart = createChart(document.getElementById('chart'));
const candles = chart.addSeries(CandlestickSeries, {});
candles.setData([{ time: 1, open: 100, high: 102, low: 99, close: 101 }]);
```

Or drop in the global build from a CDN — no bundler required:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@stocksharp/chart"></script>
<script>
  const chart = SSChart.createChart(document.getElementById('chart'));
</script>
```

### The UI layer

The engine draws; `@stocksharp/chart/ui` draws the controls around it — the crosshair
legend, the right-click menu, the chart-type switcher and the indicator picker.
It is a separate entry point because a page can want one without the other: a
report with a sparkline needs no menus.

```ts
import { createChart, CandlestickSeries } from '@stocksharp/chart';
import { ChartLegend, standaloneHost, fullscreenMenuLayer } from '@stocksharp/chart/ui';
import '@stocksharp/chart/ui.css';

const legend = new ChartLegend({
  container: document.getElementById('legend'),
  host: standaloneHost,                 // your translator, formatters and toasts
  paneHost: paneManager,
  chartTypes: [{ value: 'candle', label: 'Candles', icon: 'bi bi-bar-chart-fill' }],
  menuLayer: fullscreenMenuLayer,
});
legend.init(chart);
```

Every module here takes a `ChartUiHost`: the page words its own strings, formats
its own numbers and shows its own messages. Nothing in the layer reaches for a
global, which is what lets it render on a page that is not the terminal it grew
up in. `standaloneHost` answers all three itself — English as written,
magnitude-based numbers, messages to the console — and is where a first
integration starts.

In the browser it ships as `dist/sschartui.js`, publishing `SSChartUI`. Load the
engine first: the UI layer reads it off the `SSChart` global rather than carrying
a second copy, because a chart matches a series definition by identity and a
definition from a second copy is one it does not know.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@stocksharp/indicators"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@stocksharp/chart"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@stocksharp/chart/dist/sschartui.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@stocksharp/chart/styles/chart-ui.css" />
```

The stylesheet is required — those modules emit class names and nothing else.
Every colour in it is a `--chart-ui-*` custom property with a dark default, so a
page restyles by declaring the tokens rather than by overriding rules.

## What's here

```
src/index.ts          public ESM entry (createChart, addSeries, timeScale, …)
src/core/             the chart engine (canvas render, panes, scales, hit-test)
src/chart/            the UI layer, published as @stocksharp/chart/ui:
  ui.ts               its public entry point
  chart-host.ts       what a module asks of its page: translate, format, notify, modal
  engine.ts           the engine, in one place, so the browser bundle can read it off
                      the global instead of carrying a second copy
  indicators/         IndicatorEngine + IndicatorRenderer + IndicatorSettings +
                      painters/ (the drawing half; the maths is @stocksharp/indicators)
  chart-legend.ts     OHLCV + indicator-value legend (crosshair-driven)
  chart-context-menu.ts   right-click menu; a page contributes its own rows
  chart-pane-manager.ts   oscillator sub-panes over the engine's native panes
  indicator-dialog.ts     indicator picker (search / categories / params / active list)
  chart-type-switcher.ts  candle / bar / line / area / heikin / renko / P&F
  app.ts              demo wiring — mounts the modules through their public options
styles/chart-ui.css   the layer's stylesheet, published as @stocksharp/chart/ui.css
demo/                 the showcase (index.html + terminal CSS + seeded market data)
build.mjs             esbuild -> dist/sschart.js (SSChart global), dist/sschartui.js
                      (SSChartUI) and dist/chart-app.js; also copies the indicator
                      package's dist/ssindicators.js beside them
```

The engine (`src/index.ts` / `src/core/`) is the shared source of truth; the demo
loads it as the `SSChart` global, then the UI layer on top.

## Demo

`demo/index.html` is a live trading chart driven by the real modules:

- **Main chart** — candlestick with volume, trade markers and a crosshair legend;
  the chart-type dropdown switches the render between candlestick, bar, line, area,
  Heikin-Ashi, Renko, Point & Figure, cluster (footprint) and box.
- **Indicators** — a **+ Indicator** button / right-click *Add indicator…* opens the
  real picker over the full StockSharp indicator catalog; overlays draw on the main
  chart, oscillators (RSI, MACD, …) get their own spine-synced sub-pane with a proper
  0–100 scale; the legend shows each study's value at the crosshair. All recompute
  live on the streaming feed.
- **Light / dark** theme toggle re-colours the whole stack, and a play/pause
  **Realtime** feed streams new bars with live indicator recompute.

## Usage

Load the indicator package and the engine bundle — in that order, the engine reads the
`SSIndicators` global the package publishes — then drive it with a small declarative
API. `time` is UNIX **seconds**:

```html
<div id="chart" style="width:800px;height:400px"></div>
<script src="dist/ssindicators.js"></script>
<script src="dist/sschart.js"></script>
<script>
  const chart = SSChart.createChart(document.getElementById('chart'), {
    layout: { background: { type: 'solid', color: '#131820' }, textColor: '#8b97a7' },
    grid:   { vertLines: { color: '#1e2633' }, horzLines: { color: '#1e2633' } },
    rightPriceScale: { borderColor: '#1e2633' },
    timeScale: { borderColor: '#1e2633', timeVisible: true },
    crosshair: { mode: SSChart.CrosshairMode.Normal },
  });

  // candlesticks
  const candles = chart.addSeries(SSChart.CandlestickSeries, {
    upColor: '#00c853', downColor: '#ff3d57', borderVisible: false,
  });
  candles.setData([
    { time: 1704153600, open: 120, high: 122, low: 119, close: 121 },
    { time: 1704240000, open: 121, high: 124, low: 120, close: 123 },
  ]);

  // an overlay line (e.g. a moving average) on the same pane
  const ma = chart.addSeries(SSChart.LineSeries, { color: '#f0b90b', lineWidth: 2 });
  ma.setData([{ time: 1704153600, value: 120.5 }, { time: 1704240000, value: 122.0 }]);

  // trade markers + a price line
  SSChart.createSeriesMarkers(candles, [
    { time: 1704240000, position: 'belowBar', color: '#00c853', shape: 'arrowUp', text: 'BUY' },
  ]);
  candles.createPriceLine({ price: 123, color: '#4a9eff', lineStyle: SSChart.LineStyle.Dashed, title: 'entry' });

  // realtime: same time replaces the last bar, a newer time appends a new one
  candles.update({ time: 1704326400, open: 123, high: 123.5, low: 122.8, close: 123.2 });

  chart.timeScale().fitContent();
</script>
```

Series types: `CandlestickSeries`, `BarSeries`, `LineSeries`, `AreaSeries`,
`HistogramSeries`, `RenkoSeries`, `PointFigureSeries`, `FootprintSeries`,
`ExactVolumeProfileSeries`, `ClusterSeries`, `BoxSeries2`. The legacy
`VolumeProfileSeries` is retained only as an unsupported migration marker and
does not distribute candle volume across price bins. In a TypeScript build you can instead
`import { createChart, CandlestickSeries } from '@stocksharp/chart'` and bundle it.

For the **full terminal experience** — indicator engine over the whole catalog,
crosshair legend, oscillator sub-panes, right-click menu and the picker dialog —
import them from `@stocksharp/chart/ui`; [`src/chart/app.ts`](src/chart/app.ts)
mounts every one of them through the same public options you get.

### Custom indicator painters

An indicator is drawn as one or more ordinary lines by default. To opt into a
special renderer, put a stable painter name in its `catalog.json` entry:

```json
{
  "kind": "MyIndicator",
  "name": "My indicator",
  "pane": "separate",
  "painter": "my-histogram"
}
```

Register a factory before adding that indicator. A fresh painter is created for
each indicator instance; `paint` creates and returns its series, while `update`
refreshes them on every live recalculation:

```js
SSChart.registerIndicatorPainter('my-histogram', () => ({
  paint(ctx) {
    const color = ctx.nextColor();
    const bars = ctx.addSeries('histogram', { color, title: 'My histogram' }, ctx.output('value'));
    return { series: [bars], colors: [color] };
  },
  update(ctx, series) {
    series[0].setData(ctx.output('value'));
  },
}));
```

TypeScript consumers can import the contract and registry from
`src/chart/indicators/painters/index.ts`. If a painter name is absent or is not
registered, the renderer safely falls back to normal lines.

### Exact order-flow data

Order flow uses an explicit `FootprintBar` contract. `bidVolume` is the volume of
aggressive sells executed against resting bids; `askVolume` is the volume of
aggressive buys executed against resting asks. Every level price and OHLC price
must align to the instrument tick size:

```ts
const bars = normalizeFootprintBars([{
  dataMode: OrderFlowDataMode.Exact,
  time: 1704240000,
  open: 100.00,
  high: 100.02,
  low: 99.99,
  close: 100.01,
  levels: [
    { price: 99.99, bidVolume: 18, askVolume: 0, tradeCount: 2 },
    { price: 100.00, bidVolume: 12, askVolume: 20, tradeCount: 5 },
    { price: 100.01, bidVolume: 4, askVolume: 31, tradeCount: 6 },
    { price: 100.02, bidVolume: 0, askVolume: 9, tradeCount: 1 },
  ],
}], { tickSize: 0.01 });
```

`ApproximateFootprintBar` is a separate discriminated type with only
`totalVolume` and a mandatory approximation reason. The library never invents a
bid/ask split or silently passes candle-volume distribution as exact footprint
data. Legacy `ClusterData`/`VolumeProfileData` remain explicitly deprecated
approximation contracts during compatibility migration.

Classified executions can be aggregated incrementally without rebuilding prior
bars. `FootprintAggregator.push(trade)` emits either a one-bar `update` patch for
the active interval or a one-bar `append` patch for the next interval. Bar
boundaries are aligned by `barDuration` and optional `timeOrigin`; OHLC and every
level are derived only from the supplied executions.

`calculateFootprintMetrics` is a pure calculation path for total bid/ask,
delta, POC, value area, diagonal/stacked imbalance, and auction completion. Buy
imbalance compares `ask(P)` to `bid(P - tick)`; sell imbalance compares `bid(P)`
to `ask(P + tick)`. Viewport zoom is deliberately absent from these options.

`FootprintSeries` is a regular `CustomSeriesDefinition`, so it is added with
`chart.addSeries(FootprintSeries, { tickSize, mode })` and does not add a branch
to the chart core. It supports `bid-ask`, `delta`, `total`, and `ladder` modes.
Automatic detail switches only the presentation between numbers, heatmap cells,
and an OHLC/delta summary; all three use the same cached metrics.

`calculateVolumeProfile` and `ExactVolumeProfileAccumulator` aggregate the exact
levels themselves, including POC and value area; candle volume is never spread
between low and high. The accumulator supports append and replace-last through
level deltas. `calculateDevelopingVolumeProfile` exposes cumulative POC/VAH/VAL.
For heterogeneous input, `resolveVolumeProfile` returns an explicit
`approximate` or `mixed` unavailable result instead of producing a profile.

`ExactVolumeProfileSeries` renders that calculation as a non-time-scale custom
overlay. Its range is explicitly `visible`, `fixed`, or `session`; session mode
uses serializable half-open session ranges rather than runtime callbacks. Fixed
and session profiles remain visible outside their source viewport, and optional
developing POC/VAH/VAL paths share the same selected exact bars.

`TpoSeries` is a separate Market Profile custom series. Its `TpoBar` input has
an explicit serializable `sessionId`; calculation produces per-session TPO
counts, letters, POC, value area, initial balance, and single prints. Automatic
zoom switches only between letters and compact blocks and never changes those
session calculations.

## Build & view

```
npm install        # once, to fetch esbuild and link ../JS-Indicators
npm run build      # bundles src -> dist/
npm run serve      # http://localhost:8791/demo/index.html
npm test           # typecheck + public-API snapshot + the node:test suite
```

## Tests

`build-tests.mjs` esbuild-bundles `tests/**/*.test.js` into `tests/_dist`, then
`node --test` runs them. What is covered here is the chart: series, panes, drawings,
order flow, persistence, and the indicator *engine* — how a computed series reaches a
pane, a painter and the legend.

Whether an indicator's value is right is settled in
[JS-Indicators](https://github.com/StockSharp/JS-Indicators), against a live C# build
rather than against a fixture. A number that looks wrong on screen is a bug to open
there, not here.

## Notes

- Porting the stack surfaced and fixed a few latent engine bugs (chart-level
  `priceScale(id)`, whitespace/warm-up points poisoning the price-scale bounds,
  a fallback for ordinal sub-pane scales, `scrollToRealTime`). These live in
  `src/core/` here; folding them back into the terminal's copy is a follow-up.
