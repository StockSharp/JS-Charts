// `_runtimeLastCommittedTime` used to be omitted from the literal in add(), unlike its two
// siblings `_runtimeFirstTime` and `_runtimePreviewTime`, so between add() and the first runtime
// pass it was `undefined` rather than null. _sourceNeedsHistoricalReset tested it with
// `!== null`, which an absent field passes — and then compared
// `upstream._outputChangedFromTime <= undefined`, which is false only because every comparison
// with undefined is. The right answer for the wrong reason: initialise one of those fields
// differently and the accident stops holding.
